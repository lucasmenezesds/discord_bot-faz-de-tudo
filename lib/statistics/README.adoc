== Quantitative Frequency Distribution

The `quantitative_freq_distribution.rb` is the class that have those operations.

In order to "build" the frequency distribution table for the continuous quantitative variables there will be couples steps:

. Decide the number of classes `K`
.. Where `k = Math.sqrt(n).round`

. Determine the Data Amplitude
.. Where `A = Max Value - Min Value`

. Determine the Class Amplitude
.. `c = A / (k - 1)`
.. depending on the values you are working you can round it.

//. Determine the Inferior Limit of the first class IL1
//.. `IL1 = Min Value - (c / 2)`

. Determine the Superior Limit of the first class SL1
.. `SL1 =IL1 + c`

. Being that the lower limit of the second class is:
.. `SL2 = IF2 + c`
. Then successively all classes are being built.


*Some definitions*

*Amplitude (A)* - corresponds to the difference between the highest value and the
lowest value of a data set;

*Class amplitude (c)* - consists of the difference between the limit
upper and lower limit of a class in a distribution of
frequency.
